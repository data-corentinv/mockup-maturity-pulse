# Model Card: dummy_example

## Business Description
| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Business Problem | There is a low recovery rates in our market (2-3%) with no recovery convention |
| Business Domain | Claim |
| Business Stakeholders | Axa Entity |
| Business Kpis | ['Recovery benefit rate', 'Claim recovery ratio'] |
| Business Owner | ['Claim team'] |

## Intended Use and Limitations
| Purpose | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Purpose Of Model | Detect new recovery opportunities in both ongoing and settled claims with an automated process providing a recovery probability score for all claims in motor and property lines of business |
| Model Benefits | There is an expected ROI of 1 mn â‚¬ over 3 years. The teams will be able to free 10% of their time on the relevant recovery points. |
| Intended Uses | The model should be used by batch prediction for the purpose to detect anomalies in the recovery. The model is intended to be integrated to solution XYZ |
| Factors Affecting Model Efficiency | We should look at the bias on Motor Recovery which was heavily used for training. |
| Limits | We should focus in the next iteration at having more data on the relevant slice of customer. The results should be investigated if the recall goes below 50%. This would directly impact the business production effectiveness. |
| Risk Level | low - only internal use |
| Model Output | Recovery label |
